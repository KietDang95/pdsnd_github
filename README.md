### Date created:
June 9th, 2022

### Project Title:
Final project Udacity (github)

### Description
This project is to prove the ability to understand Git concept and use command line for execution.

It's time to put what I've learned about version control and GitHub into practice! In this project, I'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor my previous BikeShare project using Git. Here's an overview of my tasks for this project.

#### Set Up Repository
First, I'll fork a repository to get my own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to my local computer. My first task will then be to add my bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude my data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing my data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.

#### Improve Documentation
Next, I'll practice creating branches using Git to make some changes to my project. In the real world, it's common to use different branches to manage the development of separate features or changes to a project. The first branch I'll work on is documentation. In this branch, I'll add project documentation in a README file, and make improvements to my docstrings for my bikeshare.py file. Then I'll push my commits back up to the remote repository.

#### Refactor Code
The next branch I'll be working on will be refactoring. Here, I can modify my bikeshare.py file to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of my code. I'll practice committing my code as I work on it, with at least three commits on this branch with meaningful messages. Notice that this branch touches the code in my bikeshare.py file, while the documentation branch touches the docstrings in my file. This means I can work on these branches simultaneously without any conflicts! This is a common practice in the real world.

#### Merge Branches
Finally, once I am finished with my work, I can merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository.
